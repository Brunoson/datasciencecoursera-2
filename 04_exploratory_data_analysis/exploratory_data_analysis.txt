Principles of plotting/exploring data --> always compare, display all the information (multivariate), think Tufte!

with() --> function used in combination with other plotting functions
        --> link with points() or lines() function for highlighting/discriminating certain data samples or use subset() function.
transform() --> seems similar to the apply method but for dataframes.

abline() --> used to display descriptive statistics or measures of spread and central tendancy

lattice plotting system --> useful for plotting multiple graphs of a variable being conditioned by various factors.

ggplot2 --> newer plotting system and a mixture of the two above.
        --> use print() function on ggplots to display.

par() --> used to specify global graphics parameters
      --> for multiple plots set par(mfrow = c(1,2)) # one row and two columns and then in the with() function use {} braces
        to denote the different plotting options.

plotting to a different graphics device --> this is the device window manager etc. but also includes printing to pdf, use pdf() function
                                        followed by dev.off() function to flush.
                                          --> also can use dev.copy() function!!!

clustering analysis --> using hierarchical plotting, knearest-neighbours, and kmeans
                    --> dist() function for generating the distance matrix (kernel matrix).

dimensionality reduction --> using principle component analysis and singular value decomposition
                          --> scale() function to scale the data appropriately.

visualisation and colour --> colourramp, colouramppalette, and RcolourBrewer. These are very similar to the
                            colour palette system in python.
                          --> can use heatmap() or image() functions to display output.
                          --> segments() function can be used to connect points plotted on the display device.

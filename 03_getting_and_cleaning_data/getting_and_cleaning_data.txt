file.exits()  --> check if file or directory exists and creates if not.
dir.create()

download.file() --> downloads files from an url/the web
                --> on mac set method="curl"

read.table()  --> related to read.csv() and read.csv2()

read.xlsx() --> library xlsx package
            --> read.xlsx2()
write.xlsx()

XML data format --> XML package, xmlTreeParse(), xmlRoot()
extracting parts of an xml file --> xmlSApply(), can use an regex form of parsing.

JSON data format --> library jsonlite, fromJSON( pretty=TRUE), makes the layout human readable
              --> can take an url or a json object

data.table()  --> similar to data.frame though written in C and much much faster
              --> view data.tables in memory using tables() function
              --> differs from data.frame when subsetting columns. Need to use expressions rather than vector of column names

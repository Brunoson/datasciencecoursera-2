Principles of plotting/exploring data --> always compare, display all the information (multivariate), think Tufte!

with() --> function used in combination with other plotting functions
        --> link with points() function for highlighting/discriminating certain data samples or use subset() function.
transform() --> seems similar to the apply method but for dataframes.

abline() --> used to display descriptive statistics or measures of spread and central tendancy

lattice plotting system --> useful for plotting multiple graphs of a variable being conditioned by various factors.

ggplot2 --> newer plotting system and a mixture of the two above.

par() --> used to specify global graphics parameters
      --> for multiple plots set par(mfrow = c(1,2)) # one row and two columns and then in the with() function use {} braces
        to denote the different plotting options.

plotting to a different graphics device --> this is the device window manager etc. but also includes printing to pdf, use pdf() function
                                        followed by dev.off() function to flush.
                                          --> also can use dev.copy() function!!!

When implementing a linear model (regression) in R use the following:

lm --> dependent var ~ independent vars (include -1 in the independant variables to remove the constant intercept from the model). 
		--> This also has the summary, predict, confint, and resid functions defined.
		--> useful for determining the significance of parameter estimates and confidence and prediction intervals.
		--> use update() function and anova to do nested model fitting and analysis.

pairs() --> useful for exploratory data analysis by plotting all pairs of variables.

influence.measures --> used to determine regression model fits etc. Has some relation to outliers.
					--> dfbetas the influence of one sample point on the coefficients.
					--> hatvalues the leverage of the model fit?

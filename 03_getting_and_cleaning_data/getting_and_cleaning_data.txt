file.exits()  --> check if file or directory exists and creates if not.
dir.create()

download.file() --> downloads files from an url/the web
                --> on mac set method="curl"

read.table()  --> related to read.csv() and read.csv2()

read.xlsx() --> library xlsx package
            --> read.xlsx2()
write.xlsx()

XML data format --> XML package, xmlTreeParse(), xmlRoot()
extracting parts of an xml file --> xmlSApply(), can use an regex form of parsing.

JSON data format --> library jsonlite, fromJSON( pretty=TRUE), makes the layout human readable
              --> can take an url or a json object

data.table()  --> similar to data.frame though written in C and much much faster
              --> view data.tables in memory using tables() function
              --> differs from data.frame when subsetting columns. Need to use expressions rather than vector of column names

summary() --> useful for describing the data frame and information contained therein.
str()     --> similar to python str() function.

quantile()  --> quantiles for quantitative variables.

xtabs() --> useful for cross tabulated data, think confusion matrix style.

creating binary variables --> ifelse() function
creating categorical variables --> use cut() and cut2() functions. Can also use factor() function.

reshaping data --> can explode row entries with multiple columns into multiple row entries using the melt() function.
melt()   -->
dcast()   --> also used to reshape data frames. The '~' operator is used to breakdown a variables by another variable, for example a two dimensional plot.
          --> Do not confuse this with conditioning in the lattice() plotting system which uses | symbol.

merge()  --> merge data frames on common column names, similar to joins in sql and python.

tolower() , toupper(), strsplit(), grep(), sub(), gsub() --> text editing functions.
